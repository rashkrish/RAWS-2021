# RAWS-2021
## Detecting a Pulsar in Ooty Radio Telescope Voltage Data
**Key Contributions:**
- Developed Python scripts to process and analyze Ooty Radio Telescope voltage signals, visualizing voltage time series and plotting a Gaussian distribution to model the signal data.
- Implemented Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) to calculate the Power Spectral Density (PSD), enabling the analysis of power distribution in frequency bins and visualizing changes in the power spectrum over time using a Dynamic Spectrum.
- Conducted de-dispersion of the dynamic spectrum across spectral bins, resulting in a single time series for further analysis, and integrated the frequency data to produce a final time series plot for pulsar detection.
### OVERVIEW
- During the Radio Astronomy Winter School (RAWS) 2021, I performed data analysis tasks using
Python, focusing on ”Detecting a pulsar in Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT) voltage data.”
#### AIM :-
1) Visualize the voltage time-series
2) Plot and characterize the distribution of the telescope voltage data
3) Visualize the power time-series
4) Plot and characterize the distribution of the power values
5) Power Spectral Density: obtain the distribution of power in various frequency bins
6) Dynamic spectrum: visualize the change in power spectral density as a function of time
7) Use de-dispersion and phase folding to recover the pulsar’s integrated pulse profile.
