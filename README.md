## Detecting a Pulsar in Ooty Radio Telescope Voltage Data

- During the Radio Astronomy Winter School (RAWS) 2021, I performed data analysis tasks using
Python, focusing on ”Detecting a pulsar in Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT) voltage data.”
- My responsibilities included processing voltage signals, visualizing voltage time series, plotting a
Gaussian distribution on voltage data, visualizing power time series, analyzing power distribution
in frequency bins (Power Spectral Density), visualizing the Dynamic Spectrum to observe changes
in power spectral density over time, obtaining de-dispersed dynamic spectrum across all spectral
bins to derive a single time series, and finally plotting the single frequency-integrated time series.

### AIM :-
1) Visualize the voltage time-series
2) Plot and characterize the distribution of the telescope voltage data
3) Visualize the power time-series
4) Plot and characterize the distribution of the power values
5) Power Spectral Density: obtain the distribution of power in various frequency bins
6) Dynamic spectrum: visualize the change in power spectral density as a function of time
7) Use de-dispersion and phase folding to recover the pulsar’s integrated pulse profile.
